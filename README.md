# Random-Forest

A simplistic implementation of Random Forest using Scikit-learn, Pandas and Python uses CSV as input and stores the model using Pickel

Brief Description of Snippet:

The code is used to read data from CSV format and train the Random forest model. The code saves the model for persistence using pickel module in python. The code also includes the syntax for point prediction of output using test input.

Steps:

1. Read input and output from CSV file using Pandas
2. Split the training and testing dataset
3. Initialize the model and train it with the training dataset created in step 2
4. Display the accuracy score of the model
5. Save the model using pickle to load and use it later for analysis
6. Make point prediction
